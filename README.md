## LinkedIn Data Sync

CGA's demo used **manually researched public LinkedIn metrics** (reactions, comments, reposts) — not a live scraper. This project adds automated sync on top of that same data model.

```bash
# Pull live public posts (requires Apify token)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add APIFY_TOKEN from https://console.apify.com

npm run sync:linkedin

# Or use curated seed data (BeOne posts, CGA-style)
npm run sync:linkedin:seed
```

Cached posts are saved to `data/linkedin-posts.json` and used by all reports. Use **Pull Latest Data** on the dashboard or `POST /api/sync/linkedin`.

| Provider | Env | What it pulls |
|----------|-----|---------------|
| `apify` | `APIFY_TOKEN` | Public company posts (reactions, comments, captions) |
| `linkedin` | `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` + `LINKEDIN_ORGANIZATION_ID` | Official API (requires client OAuth) |
| `seed` | — | Curated research corpus |
